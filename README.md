## Developed Skills
Throughout the creation of this project, I've gained extensive knowledge about server-side development. I've become proficient in using Node modules and importing packages via NPM. Additionally, I've learned about Express and other web server frameworks. My understanding of databases has expanded to include both relational databases like SQL and non-relational databases such as MongoDB, along with their respective advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, I've learned how to secure data using CORS.

On the client-side, I've mastered using React and React-Bootstrap, learning how to create and utilize components effectively. Although not applied in this project, I also explored the fundamentals and benefits of Redux.
